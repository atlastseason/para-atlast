  <p>new year time to recalibrate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hey Hey HEY! It’s new year&hellip; AGAIN!? <em>Wow</em>. Time flies!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snakey Year is upon us and it is time for me to recalibrate myself for a better future!</p>
<p>I have done this exercise that would set my course towards my goals. <a href="https://rm-rethink.b-cdn.net/AnnualReview.pdf?utm_source=sfmc&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Rethink_001_January_25_BuyersAndUsers_SS_CC_241228&amp;utm_term=https%3a%2f%2frm-rethink.b-cdn.net%2fAnnualReview.pdf&amp;utm_id=669498">You can try it out yourself!</a></p>
<p>It gave me much more clearer vision on what I’m going to do next. Here is my promises that I gave myself and I want to share with you today.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get rid of Debt</li>
<li>Finishing making my Home</li>
<li>Have a monthly income</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="get-rid-of-debt">Get rid of Debt</h2>
<p>Did you know that building one house use all of your money and reserve cash? Yeah, I underestimated how much I would need before making a move to a new place with my family. I have to cover on all aspects of building a house; From hiring a bunch of builders&ndash;Foundations, Bricks and Mortars, and so much more, to making sure that all the materials necessary for building each of the steps. I would have to buy them one by one. Get to choose your material when building a house is one hell of an experience but that’s for another day.</p>
<p>Every step I have to take were litter with upfront and indirect costs that would occur back and forth. All of my money, reserved and cash, has nearly been exhausted. I would eventually need to loan some of them from credits.</p>
<p><em>If the foundation is not stable and strong, we would have a lot of problem down the road.</em></p>
<p>That’s why we need to make sure that we have all the we need, even we are paying more than we expected.</p>
<p>My first promise of this year is to get rid of all of my debt as soon as possible.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-making-my-home">Finishing making my Home</h2>
<p>From what I told, I have been in charge of making sure the house is built correctly. Even sometimes I don’t know what is right or wrong, I have to look up and study from the builder themself to know what has to be done to have a good house.</p>
<p>Every step, I got to chose. It’s like playing the Sims but you cannot instantly build something, cost you every time you fixing or moving anything, and you have to actually live in one. It’s a weird and valuable experiences I would face in my whole life.</p>
<p>For that, I would need to focus a lot of energy to wrap this house up so we can move and live in it, possibly by the end of January but we’ll see!</p>
<p>Let’s be clear, I’m not going to be absent altogether. But I want to let you know that I’m still alive and well, beside a little dirty from crawling through building site everyday. After this, I will be making art full-time again!</p>
<h2 id="have-a-monthly-income">Have a monthly income</h2>
<p>I haven’t been in a 9-5 for 9 months now and possible won’t be anytime soon. My circumstances and my own focus is not in being a salary man for one company but an independent force that can serve anyone who need my assistance.</p>
<p>My goal for monthly income is to making sure I have stable and enough incomes each month. I’m looking at my past salary rate as a baseline but right now 440 USD for me to be able to eat properly!</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>For these three promises that I want to keep and make it happen. I want to announce it, publicly.</p>
<p>I believed that if I’m ever going to make my goal succeed, I would need your help. This is the first help I need, for you to be my witnesses and silently pressure me from behind and I could perform better! (My brains are weird)</p>
<h3 id="thats-it-for-today">That’s it for today</h3>
<p>I want to update you guys on what’s happening at least once a day.</p>
<p>I want to make it happen. I <em>need</em> to make it happen!</p>
<p>Thank you for being here with me today.</p>
